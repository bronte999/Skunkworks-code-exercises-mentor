# Skunkworks-code-exercises
This repo contains exercises for the programming subteam of FRC team 1983 (Skunk Works Robotics). The code here may contain "*the answers*", so **if you're a student on the team, please don't go rooting around in here without permission**. Maybe I'll shell out the $7 a month to make this private at some point, but for now, do yourself a favor and don't ruin your opportunity to learn. The following exercises exist here:

#PIDDebug
Debugging practice using simulated PID controllers, encoders, and motors. Students will solve a variety of common compile errors, runtime crashes and logic mistakes while fixing the supplied broken program. Students will be taught about basic debugger features to help with this project. The fully-working program is a useful tool for learning about and examining the functionality of PID controllers.

#robotInventory
Coding practice with arrays, loops, conditionals, and strings. Students will work on the basics of C++ while making a program to track what parts are present on a robot.

#linkedList
Coding and design practice with classes and pointers. Students will learn about dealing with references and designing object-oriented code as they solve a canonical programming problem. This exercise also serves as an introduction to dynamic data structures.

#ghost
A competitive introduction to AI. Students will learn about file I/O and designing data structures for performance while creating bots to play a word game.
